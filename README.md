### Extensions

We highly recommend the use of [Privacy Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect#get),
a browser extension that automatically redirects Youtube URLs to any Invidious instance and replaces
embedded youtube videos on other websites with invidious.

The documentation contains a list of browser extensions that we recommended to use along with Invidious.

You can read more here: https://docs.invidious.io/applications/
